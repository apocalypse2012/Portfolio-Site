        Modern Video Game production is a complex process. Its many disciplines form an ecosystem whose parts require specialized products of their own. Tech Art is one of the disciplines to grow out of this environment to help art departments meet the technical challenges of content integration and service their unique engineering needs separate from that of the game. <br><br>
        I've compiled a small sampling of my work that demonstrates my expertise as well as the value proposition of the discipline itself. Feel free to look around and let me know what you think!

        Technical Art is becoming a more widely known discipline within the Industry and among educators. We have always been there in one form or another, absorbing the details that underlie the medium.<br><br>
        My story starts before Techart but has always pointed in that direction one way or another. Learn more about what I have done and why I do what I do.
